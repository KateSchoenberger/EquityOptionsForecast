**ARIMA Options Forecasting** is an ARIMA Python project that predicts the future prices of equity options based on historical price data (univariate). Using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, this tool can forecast the next 12 months of option prices using the previous 12â€“24 months of historical data.

This project is designed as a **modular, class-based system**, making it easy to extend for multiple options, different strike prices, or additional time series. It is ideal for traders, analysts, or developers interested in prototyping option price forecasts and understanding historical trends.
